## Overview

In this article, we will explore how to leverage the Spring Boot Profiles feature in an AWS Lambda Compute environment to configure and activate specific settings for each environment, such as development, testing, integration, and production.<!--excerpt--> Spring Boot Profiles provide a powerful mechanism for configuring applications for different deployment environments, allowing developers to define environment-specific properties, such as database credentials, caching settings, or logging levels. By using Spring Boot Profiles with AWS Lambda, developers can easily manage and switch between multiple configurations for their applications, making it easier to maintain and deploy code across different environments. In this article, we will walk through the steps to define and activate different Spring Boot Profiles in an AWS Lambda Compute environment, giving you the tools you need to build and deploy robust, scalable applications on the cloud.

### Spring Boot Profiles

Note that any spring components annotated with the following can be annotated with @Profile to limit what profile they are loaded.

- @Component (and all sub-annotations: @Controller, @Repository, @Service, etc..)
- @Configuration
- @ConfigurtionProperties 

Additional information can be found on Spring Boot Profiles here

- [https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-profiles)

### Activating Spring Profiles

In AWS Lambda **Environment Variables** we will be activating spring provides via environment variable **SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE**.
Additional profiles can also be provided using comma-separated values (i.e. prod,secure to activate both prod and secure profile).
In this scenario, spring boot AWS lambda application will be activating the configurations: application-&lt;profile&gt;.yml.  

The following AWS Lambda Console Environment variables configuration will activate the profile *prod* during execution.

### Initial Execution (Cold Starts)

AWS Lambda cold starts occur when the very first request arrives after deployment.  After the first request is
executed, the AWS Lambda instance will be available to be utilized for subsequent requests.  There is no specific
settings on how long a lambda instance will be kept but the probability of having a good chance of a cold start will
occur between 1 and 10 minutes after initialization.  

Cold start will have an initial cost **Init Duration** in addition to the **Duration** of the execution.

The Cold Start initialization for this example is 3317.31 ms and an execution of 2122.24 ms.
Subsequent executions have the duration of 2.33 ms (and zero-cost initialization) which is significantly faster.
