## Overview

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is an independent agency of the U.S. government that provides deposit insurance to protect depositors in case their bank or savings institution fails. FDIC insurance covers up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category.<!--excerpt-->

The coverage applies to deposits in checking, savings, money market, and certificate of deposit (CD) accounts. It also covers time deposits such as CDs and IRA accounts. The coverage does not extend to investments in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, life insurance policies, or annuities.

FDIC insurance is automatically provided to depositors at FDIC-insured banks and savings institutions. The majority of banks and savings institutions in the United States are FDIC-insured.

In the event that a bank or savings institution fails, the FDIC will step in to pay depositors up to the insured amount per account. The FDIC will either transfer the account to another FDIC-insured bank or savings institution or provide the depositor with a check for the insured amount.

It's important to note that the FDIC insurance limit applies per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. So if you have more than $250,000 in deposits at one bank, you may want to consider opening accounts at other FDIC-insured institutions to ensure that all of your deposits are fully covered.

## What happens at the beginning of the bank failure under FDIC?

When a bank fails, the FDIC is typically appointed as the receiver of the failed bank. The FDIC takes over the bank's operations and begins the process of resolving the bank's affairs.

The FDIC will first conduct a thorough review of the bank's financial condition and determine the extent of its losses. This includes identifying all of the bank's assets, such as loans and investments, as well as its liabilities, such as customer deposits and other obligations.

Once the FDIC has a clear understanding of the bank's financial condition, it will take steps to resolve the bank's affairs in an orderly manner. This may involve selling some or all of the bank's assets to another institution, transferring customer deposits to another bank, or liquidating the bank's assets and paying off its creditors.

Throughout this process, the FDIC works to protect depositors by ensuring that insured deposits are returned to customers as quickly as possible. The FDIC will typically provide updates to customers about the status of their accounts and any actions they need to take, such as opening a new account at another bank to receive their insured funds.

It's important to note that in most cases, depositors will receive their insured funds within a few days of the bank's failure. In rare cases where the bank's affairs are more complex, the process may take longer. However, the FDIC is committed to ensuring that depositors are protected and their insured funds are returned to them as quickly and efficiently as possible.

## What can a bank customer do when their FDIC-insured bank collapses?

If your FDIC-insured bank were to fail, there are several steps you should take to protect your funds and ensure that you have access to your money:

1. Don't panic: The FDIC is designed to protect depositors, and in most cases, insured deposits are returned to customers within a few days of the bank's failure.

1. Verify that your bank is FDIC-insured: Check the FDIC's BankFind tool (https://www.fdic.gov/bankfind/) to confirm that your bank is FDIC-insured. If it is not, your deposits may not be insured.

1. Contact the FDIC: The FDIC will usually contact depositors of a failed bank within a few days of the bank's closure. If you have not heard from the FDIC, you can call their toll-free number at 1-877-ASK-FDIC (1-877-275-3342) or visit their website at www.fdic.gov/bankfailure.

1. Verify your account balances: Make sure that your account balances are accurate and up-to-date, including any accrued interest.

1. Open a new account at another FDIC-insured bank: To ensure that you have access to your funds, open a new account at another FDIC-insured bank and arrange to have your insured deposits transferred to your new account.

1. Keep track of your FDIC insurance coverage: If you have more than $250,000 in deposits at one bank, consider opening accounts at other FDIC-insured institutions to ensure that all of your deposits are fully covered.

1. Stay informed: The FDIC will provide updates about the status of your accounts and any actions you need to take, such as completing a claims form to receive your insured funds.

By taking these steps, you can help ensure that your funds are protected and that you have access to your money in the event that your bank fails.

## How does a consumer like me benefit from FDIC?

As a consumer, you benefit from FDIC insurance in several ways:


1. Protection of your deposits: FDIC insurance protects your deposits at FDIC-insured banks and savings institutions, up to the insurance limit of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. This means that even if your bank fails, you will be able to recover your insured deposits.

   - Peace of mind: Knowing that your deposits are insured by the FDIC can give you peace of mind and help you feel more secure about your financial future.

1. Encourages competition among banks: FDIC insurance promotes competition among banks by creating a level playing field for insured institutions. This encourages banks to offer competitive rates and services to attract and retain customers.

1. Easy access to your funds: Because the vast majority of banks and savings institutions in the United States are FDIC-insured, you have a wide range of options for where to deposit your funds. This means you can easily access your funds whenever you need them, knowing that they are protected by the FDIC.

1. Overall, FDIC insurance is a crucial part of the U.S. banking system, providing consumers with a safety net that helps protect their hard-earned money and promotes financial stability.


## How does FDIC cover joint accounts?

The FDIC covers joint accounts in the same way as individual accounts. Each co-owner of a joint account is insured up to $250,000 for their share of the account. For example, if two people co-own a joint account with a balance of $500,000, each co-owner would be insured for up to $250,000, resulting in full coverage for the account.

It's important to note that the ownership of the account determines the amount of FDIC insurance coverage. If you have a joint account with someone and also have individual accounts at the same bank, each account ownership category would be insured up to $250,000.

For example, if you have a joint account with your spouse and individual accounts in your name only, you would be insured up to $250,000 for your share of the joint account and up to $250,000 for each of your individual accounts, for a total of $750,000 in FDIC insurance coverage at that bank.

However, if you have joint accounts with multiple co-owners, each co-owner's share of the account would be insured up to $250,000. So, for example, if you have a joint account with three other people with a balance of $1 million, the FDIC insurance coverage would be limited to $250,000 per co-owner, resulting in a total coverage of $1 million for the account.

## In Conclusion

In conclusion, while it can be concerning to think about the possibility of a bank failure, it's important to remember that FDIC insurance is designed to protect depositors and ensure that their funds are returned to them in the event that their bank fails. By verifying that your bank is FDIC-insured, keeping track of your account balances, and staying informed about the status of your accounts, you can help ensure that you have access to your funds and that your deposits are fully covered by FDIC insurance. The FDIC is committed to maintaining the stability and security of the U.S. banking system, and depositors can have confidence in the protection provided by FDIC insurance.
