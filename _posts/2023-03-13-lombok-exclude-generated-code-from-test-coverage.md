## Overview

When using Lombok in a Java project, the library generates code at compile-time, such as getters, setters, constructors, equals and hashCode methods, and more. <!--excerpt-->This generated code can impact the accuracy of test coverage reports, since the generated code is not explicitly tested in unit tests. To exclude the generated code from test coverage reports, you can use Maven Surefire plugin to exclude the generated code files from the coverage reports. This is accomplished by configuring the plugin to exclude files with the Lombok-generated suffix _*.java. By excluding these files from the coverage report, you can get a more accurate view of the actual test coverage of your project.

## Excluding Generated Code From Report

When using Maven to generate test coverage reports, you may want to exclude the generated code from the report to get a more accurate view of the actual test coverage. Here's how you can exclude generated code from test coverage when using Lombok with Maven:

1. Add the following plugin to your Maven pom.xml file:

```xml
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>3.0.0-M5</version>
      <configuration>
        <excludes>
          <exclude>**/*_.java</exclude>
        </excludes>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

2. The `**/*_.java` pattern in the _excludes_ element will exclude all Java files generated by Lombok from the test coverage report. The _* suffix is used by Lombok to mark generated files.
With this configuration, the generated code will be excluded from the test coverage report, giving you a more accurate view of the actual test coverage.

## In Conclusion

Excluding generated code from test coverage reports is an important step in ensuring accurate and meaningful test coverage results for Java projects that use Lombok. By following the steps outlined above and configuring the Maven Surefire plugin to exclude the generated code files, you can get a more accurate view of your test coverage and make more informed decisions about the quality of your code.
