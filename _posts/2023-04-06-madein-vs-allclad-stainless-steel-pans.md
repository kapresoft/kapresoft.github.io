### Country of Origin

![Made In Italy](https://cdngh.kapresoft.com/img/madein-1-6f3248c.jpg "Made In Italy")

_Made In_ is a US-based company that manufactures its products in the USA, Italy, and France, with the majority of their production still taking place in the USA and France. On the other hand, _All-Clad_ is also made in the USA, but it is important to note that some of their components, such as handles, may be sourced from other countries like China. If you prefer to buy products that are made in your own country, this may be a factor to consider.

### Longevity of Made In and All-Clad frying pans

Both _Made In_ and _All-Clad_ produce high-quality frying pans that are designed to last for many years with proper care and use. The lifespan of the pans will depend on various factors such as how frequently they are used, how well they are maintained, and what kind of cooking surface they are used on.

Both brands offer durable materials such as stainless steel and copper that can withstand high temperatures and resist warping. However, _All-Clad_ is known for its tri-ply and five-ply construction, which provides even heat distribution and helps prevent hot spots on the cooking surface. _Made In_ also offers tri-ply construction in some of its pans, which helps to ensure even heating.

Overall, with proper care and use, both _Made In_ and _All-Clad_ frying pans should last for many years, potentially even a lifetime.

### Cleaning

Both _Made In_ and _All-Clad_ stainless steel frying pans are generally easy to clean. Stainless steel is a non-reactive material that resists staining and is easy to wipe clean.

It is important to note that stainless steel pans can sometimes develop brown or discolored spots, commonly referred to as "stainless steel rainbow," especially if they are exposed to high heat or if food is left to burn on the surface. However, this discoloration is purely cosmetic and does not affect the performance of the pan.

To clean stainless steel pans, it is recommended to use a non-abrasive cleaner, such as Bar Keepers Friend or a mixture of baking soda and water. Avoid using harsh abrasives or steel wool, as they can scratch the surface of the pan.

## Warranty

Both _Made In_ and _All-Clad_ provide warranties for their cookware products to give customers added assurance. However, it's essential to note that both warranties have limitations and exclusions, such as damage caused by misuse, high heat, or normal wear and tear. It's important to read the terms carefully to understand what is and is not covered so that you can take proper care of your cookware and make use of any repair or replacement options available.
