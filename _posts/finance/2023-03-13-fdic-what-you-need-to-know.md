## Overview

The FDIC is a government agency that helps to protect your money if your bank fails. If your bank is FDIC-insured, your deposits are insured up to $250,000 in case something goes wrong. This means that you can feel secure knowing that your money is safe and protected.<!--excerpt-->

Please review the [Disclaimer](/disclaimer.html) prior to proceeding with this article.

FDIC coverage protects the money you deposit in certain types of accounts at a bank or savings institution, like checking, savings, money market, and CD accounts, up to $250,000 per account ownership category. However, investments like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, life insurance policies, and annuities are not covered by FDIC insurance.

FDIC insurance is like a special shield that protects your money when you put it in a piggy bank at a special bank or savings place. Most banks and savings places in the United States have this shield to protect your money, so you don't need to worry about it.

Sometimes, a bank or a special savings place might not be able to keep your money safe. But if that happens, there is a special group called the FDIC that will help you get your money back. They will either move your account to a different safe bank or give you a check for the money you had in the old bank, up to a certain amount that they promised to protect.

It's essential to understand that FDIC insurance has a limit on the amount it can cover per depositor, per insured bank, and for each account ownership category. Therefore, if you have more than $250,000 in deposits at a single bank, you might want to consider spreading your deposits across different FDIC-insured institutions to make sure all of your money is fully protected. This way, you can avoid losing any of your funds in case something happens to the bank or savings institution where you have your deposits.

## What happens at the beginning of the bank failure under FDIC?

When a bank can't keep your money safe and fails, the FDIC takes over and becomes responsible for the bank. They check how much money the bank has and how much it owes to people like you who deposited your money in the bank. They look at all the things the bank has, like loans and investments, and all the things it owes, like the money you put in your account. This helps them figure out how to solve the bank's problems and keep your money safe.

After the FDIC checks the bank's money situation, they figure out how to fix things in an organized way. This can include selling some or all of the bank's things, like loans or investments, to another bank. Or they might move the money that people like you put in the bank to a different bank. In some cases, they might even sell everything the bank has and use the money to pay back the people the bank owes money to. The goal is to solve the problem in a way that keeps your money safe and makes things fair for everyone involved.

While they're fixing the bank's problems, the FDIC wants to make sure that people who put their money in the bank get it back as soon as possible. They keep you informed about what's happening with your account and tell you what to do next. For example, they might ask you to open a new account at another bank to get your money back. The FDIC is there to help you and make sure you don't lose your hard-earned money.

Usually, you'll get your money back in a few days if the bank fails. But if the situation is complicated, it might take longer. Don't worry though, the FDIC is working hard to make sure you get your money back as soon as they can. They're always on your side and want to keep your money safe.

## What can a bank customer do when their FDIC-insured bank collapses?

If your FDIC-insured bank were to fail, there are several steps you should take to protect your funds and ensure that you have access to your money:

1. **Don't panic:** If you're worried about losing your money if the bank fails, don't be! The FDIC is there to protect you. Usually, you'll get your money back in just a few days after the bank fails. They're here to make sure you don't lose your money and can keep saving for the future.

2. **Verify that your bank is FDIC-insured:** To make sure your money is safe, check if your bank is FDIC-insured. You can do this by using the FDIC's BankFind tool. Just go to [https://www.fdic.gov/bankfind](https://www.fdic.gov/bankfind/) and type in the name of your bank. If it's FDIC-insured, that means your money is protected. But if it's not, you might want to put your money somewhere else that is insured.

3. **Contact the FDIC:** If your bank fails, the FDIC will usually get in touch with you within a few days to let you know what's happening with your money. But if you haven't heard anything and you're worried, you can call the FDIC at their toll-free number 1-877-ASK-FDIC (1-877-275-3342) or visit their website at [https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/) to find out more.

4. **Verify your account balances:** It's important to check that the amounts shown on your account statement are correct and include any interest that you may have earned.

5. **Open a new account at another FDIC-insured bank:** If your bank fails, you can't get to your money until the FDIC gives it back to you. To make sure you have access to your money, you can open a new account at another bank that's also insured by the FDIC. Then, you can ask the FDIC to move your money from your old account to your new one.

6. **Keep track of your FDIC insurance coverage:** If you have lots of money saved up, like more than $250,000, it's a good idea to spread it out across different banks to make sure it's all protected. That way, if something happens to one bank, you won't lose all your money. Just make sure that all the banks you choose are FDIC-insured so your money is safe.

7. **Stay informed:** The FDIC will give you information about your accounts and tell you what you need to do to get your money back, like filling out a form to get your insured funds.

If you take these steps, you can make sure that your money is safe and that you can still get to it if your bank fails.

## How does a consumer like me benefit from FDIC?

As a consumer, you benefit from FDIC insurance in several ways:


1. **Protection of your deposits:** FDIC insurance is like a safety net that protects your money at the bank. If your bank is FDIC-insured, and it fails, you can still get your money back, up to $250,000 for each type of account you have (like checking or savings). So you don't need to worry about losing your hard-earned money.

2. **Peace of mind:** Knowing that your deposits are insured by the FDIC can give you peace of mind and help you feel more secure about your financial future.

3. **Encourages competition among banks:** FDIC insurance makes it fair for all banks that have it, so they all have to follow the same rules. This makes banks try harder to give good deals and services to people, so they can keep their customers happy and get new ones too.

4. **Easy access to your funds:** Since most banks and savings institutions in the US are FDIC-insured, you have many choices on where to keep your money. This makes it easy to get to your funds when you need them and you can be sure they're safe because they're protected by the FDIC.

Overall, FDIC insurance is a crucial part of the U.S. banking system, providing consumers with a safety net that helps protect their hard-earned money and promotes financial stability.

## How does FDIC cover joint accounts?

When you open a joint account with someone, the FDIC will protect the funds in the same way as individual accounts. This means that each co-owner of the joint account is insured for up to $250,000 for their share of the account. For instance, if you and another person jointly hold an account with a total balance of $500,000, each of you would be covered for up to $250,000, making the whole account fully insured.

Remember that the amount of FDIC insurance coverage is determined by the ownership of the account. For instance, if you have a joint account and individual accounts at the same bank, each account ownership category is insured up to $250,000.


Let's say you have a joint account with your spouse and also have individual accounts in your name at the same bank. In this case, your share of the joint account is insured up to $250,000, and each of your individual accounts is insured up to $250,000, resulting in a total FDIC insurance coverage of $750,000 at that bank.

If you have a joint bank account with multiple people, each person can only be protected up to $250,000 for their share of the account. So, if you have a joint account with three other people that has $1 million, each person would only be protected up to $250,000, which adds up to $1 million in total protection for the account.

## In Conclusion

In conclusion, while it can be concerning to think about the possibility of a bank failure, it's important to remember that FDIC insurance is designed to protect depositors and ensure that their funds are returned to them in the event that their bank fails. By verifying that your bank is FDIC-insured, keeping track of your account balances, and staying informed about the status of your accounts, you can help ensure that you have access to your funds and that your deposits are fully covered by FDIC insurance. The FDIC is committed to maintaining the stability and security of the U.S. banking system, and depositors can have confidence in the protection provided by FDIC insurance.
