### Ingredients:
- 3-4 lbs beef short ribs
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 carrots, peeled and finely chopped
- 2 stalks celery, finely chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 cup full-bodied red wine, such as Cabernet Sauvignon
- 2-3 cups beef broth, preferably low-sodium
- 2 bay leaves
- A few sprigs of fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 sprig of rosemary
- Optional: 1-2 cups chopped mushrooms or small potatoes, or both
- Additional option: 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce for umami depth

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat your oven** to 325°F (163°C) to ensure it's ready for braising.

2. **Season the ribs** liberally with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, ensuring all sides are well-coated.

3. **Brown the ribs**: In a large Dutch oven, heat the extra virgin olive oil over medium-high heat. Working in batches, sear the ribs until golden brown on all sides, approximately 3-4 minutes per side. Remove and set aside.

4. **Sauté the base vegetables**: Add the onion, carrots, and celery to the Dutch oven, cooking until they begin to caramelize and soften, about 6-8 minutes. The fond (browned bits) on the bottom of the pan will add flavor.

5. **Add garlic and tomato paste**: Stir in the minced garlic, cooking until fragrant, about 1 minute, followed by the tomato paste. Cook until the paste deepens in color, about 3 minutes, to enhance its flavor.

6. **Deglaze**: Pour in the red wine, scraping up any fond from the pan's bottom. Allow it to reduce by half, which concentrates the flavor and burns off the alcohol, about 4-5 minutes.

7. **Return the ribs and simmer**: Add the ribs back into the Dutch oven. Pour in beef broth until the ribs are nearly submerged. Introduce the bay leaves, thyme, and rosemary. If using, add Worcestershire sauce here for an additional layer of complexity.

8. **Braise**: Once the liquid simmers, cover and transfer the Dutch oven to the preheated oven. Braise for about 2.5 to 3 hours, or until the meat is fork-tender and easily separates from the bone.

9. **Adding optional vegetables**: If including mushrooms or small potatoes, incorporate them around 1 hour before the end of cooking to ensure they are tender yet not overcooked.

10. **Finish and serve**: Remove the ribs and optional vegetables. If desired, strain the braising liquid to remove solids, then reduce it on the stovetop to thicken for a more concentrated sauce. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

11. **Plating**: Serve the ribs with a side of creamy mashed potatoes, polenta, or your favorite grains, drizzled with the rich, reduced braising sauce.
