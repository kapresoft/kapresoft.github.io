## Overview

Stream processing in Java has revolutionized how we handle data, offering a functional approach to manipulate collections. With the release of new versions, <a href="/java/2018/08/15/getting-started-with-java.html" target="_blank">Java</a> continues to enhance this capability, introducing more intuitive and concise methods to collect and transform data streams.<!--excerpt-->

This article explores the evolution of Collector methods, focusing on the shift from traditional approaches to the latest convenience methods. By understanding these changes, developers can write more readable, efficient, and cleaner code.

## Using the Old Collector Methods
In earlier versions of Java, the _Collectors_ utility class was the go-to solution for collecting elements from a stream into a container, such as a _List_, _Set_, or _Map_. The typical pattern involved chaining a _stream()_ operation with various intermediate operations, culminating with a _collect()_ terminal operation. For example, to filter and collect numbers greater than 2 from a list into another list, you'd use:

```java
List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Integer> collectedNumbers = numbers.stream()
        .filter(i -> i > 2).collect(Collectors.toList());
```

This approach, while powerful and flexible, often required more verbose code to perform what are essentially common operations. Developers needed to explicitly use the _Collectors_ class methods, adding more boilerplate to their codebase.

## Using the New Collector Convenience Methods

Since JDK 16, Java has enhanced its Stream API by introducing convenience methods like _toList()_ and _toArray()_, directly integrated into the Stream interface. These additions are designed to significantly improve code readability and reduce verbosity. Specifically tailored for the frequent use cases of collecting stream elements into lists or arrays, these methods eliminate the need for external utility methods. This development in JDK 16 represents Java's commitment to evolving with the needs of modern programming, streamlining common tasks, and offering more intuitive coding experiences. 

For instance:

```java
List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
// As List
List<Integer> collectedNumbers = numbers.stream()
        .filter(i -> i > 2).toList();

// As Array
Integer[] collectedNumbersArr = numbers.stream()
        .filter(i -> i > 3).toArray(Integer[]::new);
```

Here is the entire code _StreamCollectorTest_ that demonstrates the usage of collectors:

```java
package com.kapresoft.articles.commonapp;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

public class StreamCollectorTest {

    @Test
    void streamShouldAccumulateList_UsingTheStandardWay() {
        List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        List<Integer> collectedNumbers = numbers.stream()
                .filter(i -> i > 2).collect(Collectors.toList());
        assertThat(collectedNumbers).containsExactlyInAnyOrder(3, 4, 5);
    }

    @Test
    void streamShouldAccumulateList_UsingTheNewWay() {
        List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        // As List
        List<Integer> collectedNumbers = numbers.stream()
                .filter(i -> i > 2).toList();
        assertThat(collectedNumbers).containsExactlyInAnyOrder(3, 4, 5);

        // As Array
        Integer[] collectedNumbersArr = numbers.stream()
                .filter(i -> i > 3).toArray(Integer[]::new);
        assertThat(collectedNumbersArr).containsExactlyInAnyOrder(4, 5);
    }

}
```

These methods encapsulate the common patterns of collecting elements, making the code more intuitive and concise. The _toList()_ method collects the elements into an unmodifiable list, while _toArray()_ allows for easy conversion of stream elements into an array. This shift not only enhances code readability but also encourages developers to adopt a more functional style of coding with Java streams.

## In Conclusion

In conclusion, <a href="/java/2018/08/15/getting-started-with-java.html" target="_blank">Java</a>'s Stream API has evolved significantly with the introduction of new collector convenience methods. These methods exemplify Java's ongoing commitment to improving code readability and efficiency. As we've seen through examples, the transition from traditional collector methods like _Collectors.toList()_ to the more streamlined _toList()_ and _toArray()_ methods not only simplifies the code but also aligns with modern programming practices. Adopting these new methods can greatly enhance the developer experience, making code more concise and intuitive. As Java continues to evolve, staying updated with these changes is essential for developers seeking to write optimal and efficient code in a constantly advancing landscape.
