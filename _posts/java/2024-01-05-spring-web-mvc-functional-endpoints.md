This approach simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests and <a href="/software/2023/05/10/http-status-misunderstandings.html" target="_blank" alt="responses">responses</a>, offering a concise, expressive, and route-centric way of defining web behavior. For developers venturing into the world of Spring Web MVC, understanding and leveraging WebMvc.fn can be a game changer, offering a streamlined and efficient method for developing web services. As we delve deeper into this topic, we'll explore the nuances of WebMvc.fn, illustrating its advantages and practical applications in modern web development.

## Understanding Spring Web MVC

Spring Web MVC, a pivotal component of the Spring Framework, has revolutionized the way web applications are developed. Rooted in the <a href="/java/2024/01/03/design-patterns-mvc.html" target="_blank" alt="_Model-View-Controller_ (MVC) architecture">_Model-View-Controller_ (MVC) architecture</a>, it separates an application into three interconnected parts. This separation not only simplifies development but also enhances the scalability and maintainability of applications. The _Model_ represents the application data, the _View_ is responsible for rendering the data, and the _Controller_ manages the application logic, tying together the model and view. Spring Web MVC excels in providing a comprehensive ecosystem for building web applications, offering robust features like flexible routing, pluggable view technologies, and detailed exception handling. Its integration with Spring's Dependency Injection and its extensive suite of tools and libraries have made it a go-to choice for developers aiming to create high-performance, enterprise-level web applications.

## The Rise of Functional Endpoints

The evolution of Spring Web MVC witnessed a transformative shift with the introduction of _WebMvc.fn_, marking the move from traditional annotated controllers to functional endpoints. This change aligns with the growing trend of functional programming in the software development world. Functional endpoints in Spring Web MVC and the Spring Reactive stack represent a more declarative and concise way of defining how HTTP requests are handled. This feature is also available in the <a href="/java/2023/10/17/spring-webflux-reactive-faqs.html" target="_blank" alt="Spring Reactive">Spring Reactive</a> stack, providing developers with flexibility and choice when building web applications.

By leveraging Java 8's lambda expressions and functional interfaces, WebMvc.fn offers a route-centric approach that brings more clarity and brevity to the code. This paradigm shift not only simplifies the development process but also enhances the performance of web applications. The functional nature of these endpoints leads to more predictable and testable code, making it easier to maintain and scale. For developers, WebMvc.fn opens up a world of possibilities, allowing them to create more efficient and effective web services in a style that's both modern and developer-friendly.

## Creating Your First Functional Endpoint

Creating a functional endpoint with _WebMvc.fn_ in Spring Web MVC without using the reactive approach is straightforward and ideal for those new to the framework. Below is a step-by-step guide to set up a basic non-reactive functional endpoint.

### Step 1: Define a Handler Function
Begin by defining a handler function. This function is responsible for handling HTTP requests. For example, let's create a handler that returns a simple welcome message:

```java
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.function.ServerRequest;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.function.ServerResponse;

public class WelcomeHandler {
    public ServerResponse welcome(ServerRequest request) {
        return ServerResponse.ok().body("Welcome to Spring Web MVC!");
    }
}

```
In this example, _WelcomeHandler_ is a class with a method _welcome_ that takes a _ServerRequest_ and returns a _ServerResponse_. The response is a string: "Welcome to Spring Web MVC!".

### Step 2: Define a Router Function
Now, define a router function that maps the request to the handler. Create a new class and add a method to return the router function:

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.function.RouterFunction;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.function.RouterFunctions;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.function.ServerResponse;

@Configuration
public class WelcomeRouter {
    @Bean
    public RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route(WelcomeHandler welcomeHandler) {
        return RouterFunctions.route()
                .GET("/welcome", welcomeHandler::welcome)
                .build();
    }
}
```

In _WelcomeRouter_, the _route_ method uses _RouterFunctions.route()_ to map HTTP GET requests to _/welcome_ to the _welcome_ method in _WelcomeHandler_.

### Step 3: Run the Application
Create a <a href="/java/2023/10/01/spring-boot-conditional-annotations.html" target="_blank" alt="Spring Boot">Spring Boot</a> application class to run the application:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class WelcomeApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(WelcomeApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

Run _WelcomeApplication_ as a Java application. Once operational, test the endpoint by sending a GET request to _http://localhost:8080/welcome_. You should receive the "Welcome to Spring Web MVC!" response.

### Understanding the Flow
- The _WelcomeHandler_ class manages the business logic.
- The _WelcomeRouter_ class directs requests to the appropriate handler based on the URL and method.
- _WelcomeApplication_ initiates the Spring Boot application, enabling the router and handler to process incoming requests.

This guide demonstrates the basics of setting up a functional endpoint with _WebMvc.fn_, showcasing a clear and straightforward method to manage web requests in Spring Web MVC applications.

## Real World Example: Implementing Functional Endpoints in Spring Web MVC

In this real-world example, we explore the implementation of two functional endpoints using _WebMvc.fn_ in Spring Web MVC: a 'Get User' API and a 'Get User Collection' API. Both APIs include a self-link in the response header and body, a practice enhancing the RESTful nature of the service.

### Routing with _WebFnConfig.java_

The <a href="https://github.com/kapresoft/kapresoft-examples/blob/9aeed1b19dc6c6ba2214b7a2163e160955386bdc/spring-boot-api/src/main/java/com/kapresoft/articles/api/conf/WebFnConfig.java#L19-L23" target="_blank" alt="_WebFnConfig_">_WebFnConfig_</a> class in the implementation plays a crucial role in setting up the routing for the APIs, offering a neat and effective way to manage the routes. Here's an updated look at its structure:

```java
@Configuration
public class WebFnConfig {

    @Bean
    RouterFunction<ServerResponse> userRouter(UserHandler userHandler) {
        return RouterFunctions.route()
                .path("/fn", userHandler::routerFn)
                .build();
    }
    
}
```
<div class="link">
<small>View source on Github: <a href="https://github.com/kapresoft/kapresoft-examples/blob/9aeed1b19dc6c6ba2214b7a2163e160955386bdc/spring-boot-api/src/main/java/com/kapresoft/articles/api/conf/WebFnConfig.java" target="_blank" alt="WebFnConfig.java">WebFnConfig.java</a></small>
</div>

- **Path-Based Routing with Rerouting**: The _.path("/fn", userHandler::routerFn)_ method call in this configuration reroutes, or effectively maps, all requests with the _/fn_ path prefix to the _routerFn_ method in <a href="https://github.com/kapresoft/kapresoft-examples/blob/9aeed1b19dc6c6ba2214b7a2163e160955386bdc/spring-boot-api/src/main/java/com/kapresoft/articles/api/webfn/UserHandler.java#L25-L29" target="_blank" alt="_UserHandler_">_UserHandler_</a>. This means that the entire routing defined in _UserHandler_ is now accessible with an _/fn_ prefix, streamlining the API's URL structure.
- **Modularity and Scalability**: This approach not only ensures modularity in route management but also enhances scalability. It allows for the easy addition of new routes and handlers without cluttering the main application configuration, thereby maintaining a clean and maintainable setup.

### Endpoints in _UserHandler.java_

<a href="https://github.com/kapresoft/kapresoft-examples/blob/9aeed1b19dc6c6ba2214b7a2163e160955386bdc/spring-boot-api/src/main/java/com/kapresoft/articles/api/webfn/UserHandler.java#L25-L29" target="_blank" alt="_UserHandler_">_UserHandler_</a> contains the logic for handling user-related requests:

```java
@Component
public class UserHandler {

    // For demonstration purpose, we will use this ResponseObject.
    record ResponseObject(String link, Object results) { }

    private final UserService userService;

    public UserHandler(UserService userService) {
        this.userService = userService;
    }

    public RouterFunction<ServerResponse> routerFn() {
        return RouterFunctions.route()
                .GET("/user/{id}", accept(APPLICATION_JSON), this::specificUser)
                .GET("/user/", accept(APPLICATION_JSON), this::allUsers)
                .build();
    }

    public ServerResponse specificUser(ServerRequest request) {
        Long userId = Long.parseLong(request.pathVariable("id"));
        String selfLink = UriComponentsBuilder.fromPath(request.path())
                .build().toUriString();
        return ServerResponse.ok()
                .header("Link", selfLink)
                .body(new ResponseObject(selfLink, userService.getUserById(userId)));

    }

    public ServerResponse allUsers(ServerRequest request) {
        String selfLink = UriComponentsBuilder.fromPath(request.path())
                .build().toUriString();
        return ServerResponse.ok()
                .header("Link", selfLink)
                .body(new ResponseObject(selfLink, userService.allUsers()));
    }
}

```

- **Defining Endpoints**: The _routerFn_ method further specifies routes for individual user-related actions. It defines two GET methods: _/user/{id}_ for fetching a specific user and _/user/_ for fetching all users.
- **Handler Methods**:
    - _specificUser_: Retrieves a user based on the provided ID. It uses _UriComponentsBuilder_ to create a self-link.
    - _allUsers_: Fetches all users and includes a self-link in the response.

### Key Features of the Implementation
- **Self-Links**: Both endpoints include a self-link in the response. This is crucial for RESTful APIs as it provides a direct URL to the resource.
- **Clarity and Modularity**: The separation between routing logic and request handling (_WebFnConfig_ for routing and _UserHandler_ for request processing) enhances clarity and modularity.
- **Adherence to REST Principles**: By structuring the responses with self-links and organizing the endpoints logically, the implementation adheres closely to REST principles, making the API intuitive and easy to use.

This example illustrates how _WebMvc.fn_ can be effectively used in Spring Web MVC to create functional and REST-compliant web services, showcasing the framework's flexibility and developer-friendly nature.

### Get Specific User API

The _Get Specific User_ API allows clients to retrieve detailed information about a specific user by sending a GET request to the appropriate endpoint. In this example, we'll explore how to request information about a user with the ID of 2.

#### Request

To initiate the request, clients should send an HTTP GET request to the following endpoint:

```
GET http://localhost:8080/fn/user/2
```

Here, _2_ represents the unique identifier of the user whose information is being requested.

#### Response

Upon receiving the GET request, the server responds with an HTTP status code of _200 OK_, indicating a successful retrieval of the user's information. The response headers include:

- _Link_: Specifies a link to the resource itself, allowing for easy navigation or reference.
- _Content-Type_: Indicates that the response body is in JSON format.
- _Transfer-Encoding_ and other standard HTTP headers.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 
Link: /fn/user/2
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Fri, 05 Jan 2024 23:17:36 GMT
Keep-Alive: timeout=60
Connection: keep-alive
```

#### Response Body

The response body is in JSON format and contains the detailed information of the requested user. Here's an example of what the response body may look like:

```json
{
  "link": "/fn/user/2",
  "results": {
    "id": 2,
    "email": "linda.carter@gmail.com",
    "first": "Linda",
    "last": "Carter",
    "active": true
  }
}
```

The JSON structure includes the following key details:

- _link_: Provides a link to the resource for easy reference.

Clients can utilize this API to retrieve specific user information, allowing for seamless integration and utilization of user data within their applications.

### Get All Users API

The _Get All Users_ API allows clients to retrieve a list of all available user profiles. This endpoint provides a comprehensive view of all user data within the system.

#### Request

To initiate the request for retrieving all users, clients should send an HTTP GET request to the following endpoint:

```
GET http://localhost:8080/fn/user/
```

This request does not require any specific parameters as it aims to retrieve all users within the system.

#### Response

Upon receiving the GET request, the server responds with an HTTP status code of _200 OK_, indicating a successful retrieval of the user data. The response headers include:

- _Link_: Specifies a link to the resource itself, allowing for easy navigation or reference.
