Smoking pork spare ribs on a Masterbuilt&reg; vertical charcoal smoker/grill can yield delicious and tender results.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve mouthwatering smoked pork spare ribs:

## Ingredients

- 2 racks of pork spare ribs
- Dry rub of your choice (commercially available or homemade)
- Wood chunks or chips (such as hickory, apple, or cherry) for smoke flavor
- Barbecue sauce (optional, for glazing)

## Instructions

#### Prepare the ribs

Start by removing the thin membrane (also called the silver skin) from the bone side of the ribs. You can use a butter knife or a paper towel for better grip and pull it off. Trimming excess fat is optional.

<a id='OBfdHABfQWtZe6Yr1eht6A' class='gie-single' href='http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/472615256' target='_blank' style='color:#a7a7a7;text-decoration:none;font-weight:normal !important;border:none;display:inline-block;'>Embed from Getty Images</a><script>window.gie=window.gie||function(c){(gie.q=gie.q||[]).push(c)};gie(function(){gie.widgets.load({id:'OBfdHABfQWtZe6Yr1eht6A',sig:'l54nDyPLDX3C_pzU5IlBFrS6ciA2l8m82lsWwMfeisM=',w:'594px',h:'250px',items:'472615256',caption: false ,tld:'com',is360: false })});</script><script src='//embed-cdn.gettyimages.com/widgets.js' charset='utf-8' async></script>

#### Apply the dry rub

Generously season both sides of the ribs with your chosen dry rub. Make sure to coat the ribs evenly, gently patting the rub into the meat. Let the ribs sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to penetrate.

When applying the dry rub to the ribs, it's crucial to remember to coat not only the surfaces but also the edges of the meat. This ensures that every bite is packed with flavor and enhances the overall taste experience.

It's essential to exercise caution when it comes to the salt content in the rub. Different rubs can vary in their saltiness, and you certainly don't want to accidentally over salt the ribs. Carefully check the salt levels in each rub you use, and if necessary, taste a small amount of the rub to gauge its saltiness before applying it to the ribs.

If you find that the rub lacks adhesion, or you want to enhance its ability to stick to the meat, you can consider using a binding agent. Mustard is a popular choice as it adds a tangy flavor and helps the rub adhere to the meat. However, there are other binding agents you can use as well. For example, worcestershire sauce, honey, or even apple cider vinegar can all serve as effective binding agents. Choose one that complements the flavors you desire and helps the rub adhere evenly to the ribs.

**Avoid using olive oil** as a binding agent because it may create a barrier that can hinder the penetration of smoke into the meat. Instead, consider using alternative binding agents such as mustard, Worcestershire sauce, honey, or even apple cider vinegar. These options can help the dry rub adhere to the meat while allowing the smoke to infuse the flavors effectively.

Remember to coat the edges of the meat along with the surfaces, and carefully check the salt content in the rub. Adjust the amount of salt if needed, tasting the rub if necessary, as salt levels can vary among different rubs. By using an appropriate binding agent and ensuring proper seasoning, you can achieve well-seasoned and smoky ribs that are sure to be a delight to your taste buds.

#### Fill the Charcoal Chamber and Preheat the smoker/grill

Fill the charcoal chamber with your preferred charcoal, ensuring a sufficient amount for the smoking duration. 
Add smoke wood of choice, such as chunks of chuck for enhanced flavor, and stack them along with the charcoal to ensure consistent smoke throughout the entire smoking process. This will create the smoke flavor for your ribs. Additionally, sprinkle some wood chips in the ash bin as needed to maintain a steady smoke production.  You can experiment with different types of wood to find the flavor profile you prefer.

Adjust the control interface to a temperature of 225°F (107°C). Allow the smoker to burn for about 10 minutes or so after it reaches the target temperature. Meanwhile, fill the water pan with water and place it in the smoker/grill.

#### Arrange the ribs

Place the ribs on the smoker/grill, bone side down. Make sure there is enough space between the racks to allow the smoke and heat to circulate around them. Close the lid and let the ribs smoke for approximately 4 to 5 hours.

#### Maintain temperature and moisture

Throughout the smoking process, The Masterbuilt&trade; Gravity Series will ensure the temperature stays within the desired range. You can use a digital thermometer to monitor the temperature for a second reading.  Also, keep an eye on the water pan to ensure there is enough water to maintain moisture. Refill it with hot water if needed.

#### Temperature and Moisture Control

Maintaining optimal temperature and moisture levels is crucial for achieving tender and flavorful pork ribs. To help retain moisture and regulate the cooking process, you can employ the technique of wrapping the ribs in butcher paper or heavy-duty aluminum foil. Before wrapping, you can add a layer of flavor-enhancing ingredients such as butter and brown sugar at the bottom of the wrapping. Placing the rib bones facing up allows the meat to cook evenly and ensures the delicious juices are retained.

Throughout the smoking process, it's important to monitor the temperature closely. Use a reliable thermometer to ensure the smoker stays within the desired range. This will help ensure that the ribs cook evenly and reach the desired level of tenderness. Adjust the airflow and the amount of charcoal or wood chips as needed to maintain a consistent temperature.

In addition to temperature control, it's essential to keep an eye on the water pan. The water pan serves the purpose of adding moisture to the smoking environment. Check the water level periodically and refill with hot water if needed. This will help prevent the ribs from drying out and contribute to a moist and succulent final result.

When implementing these temperature and moisture control techniques, you can create an ideal smoking environment for your pork ribs, resulting in tender, juicy, and flavorful meat that will be a delight to savor.

#### Check for doneness

After about 4 to 5 hours, check the ribs for tenderness. They should have a nice bark (outer crust) and the meat should easily pull away from the bone. You can also use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the meat, which should be around 195°F to 205°F (90°C to 96°C). 

##### Poke through like butter

When using a thermometer probe to check the doneness of pork ribs, a helpful indicator is the desired texture. Ideally, the probe should glide through the meat with minimal resistance, much like poking through softened butter. This texture signifies that the ribs are properly cooked and tender, indicating that they have reached the desired level of doneness. By using this technique, you can ensure that your pork ribs are perfectly cooked and ready to be enjoyed.

##### Meat pulling away from the rib bones

There are a few visual cues you can look for as well. In addition to the desired texture mentioned earlier, visually inspect the ribs for another sign of doneness: the meat should be pulling away from the rib bones. As the ribs cook and become tender, you'll notice the meat starting to shrink and expose more of the bone. This visual indication suggests that the ribs are reaching their optimal level of tenderness and are nearing completion. By combining the tactile test of the thermometer probe with the visual check of meat pulling away from the bones, you can ensure that your pork ribs are cooked to perfection, resulting in a delicious and enjoyable eating experience.

##### Flimsiness

In addition to using a meat thermometer to check for doneness, another method to assess whether the ribs are done is by evaluating the overall flimsiness of the rack. When the ribs are fully cooked, they should exhibit a certain level of tenderness that can be assessed through touch.

To check for flimsiness, carefully lift the ribs with tongs or a spatula, supporting them from one end. The ribs should flex and bend easily, and the meat should feel tender when pressed or squeezed gently. If the rack feels stiff or rigid, it may indicate that the ribs need more time to cook.

It's important to note that while tenderness is a good indicator of doneness, it doesn't replace the accuracy of using a meat thermometer. The internal temperature of the ribs should still reach around 195°F (90°C) to ensure they are fully cooked and safe to eat. By combining both methods—checking for flimsiness and using a meat thermometer—you can achieve ribs that are both tender and cooked to perfection.


#### Optional glazing

If you prefer glazed ribs, you can brush them with your favorite barbecue sauce during the last 30 minutes of cooking. This will add a sweet and sticky finish. Be sure to monitor the ribs closely to prevent the sauce from burning.

<a id='GutRKnEpTTFlACEk4qgWPQ' class='gie-slideshow' href='http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/1166187432' target='_blank' style='color:#a7a7a7;text-decoration:none;font-weight:normal !important;border:none;display:inline-block;'>Embed from Getty Images</a><script>window.gie=window.gie||function(c){(gie.q=gie.q||[]).push(c)};gie(function(){gie.widgets.load({id:'GutRKnEpTTFlACEk4qgWPQ',sig:'-0RiAD28S3JDd-At1b5Dt_VNj-2pxxP76hnWAxBjr34=',w:'509px',h:'250px',items:'1166187432,185110891,157185118',caption: false ,tld:'com',is360: false })});</script><script src='//embed-cdn.gettyimages.com/widgets.js' charset='utf-8' async></script>

#### Rest and serve

Once the ribs are done, remove them from the smoker/grill and let them rest for about 10 to 15 minutes. This crucial step allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, resulting in enhanced tenderness and flavor. 

For an optional extra step, you can also choose to cool the ribs inside a cooler for a few hours. This technique, known as "resting in a cooler," further allows the flavors to meld and the meat to relax, resulting in even juicier and more succulent ribs. 

After the resting period, proceed to slice the ribs between the bones and serve them hot. Whether you prefer to enjoy them as they are or with a side of barbecue sauce, these perfectly cooked and rested ribs are sure to impress your guests and satisfy your taste buds.

Remember, smoking times may vary depending on factors such as the thickness of the ribs, the outside temperature, and the efficiency of your smoker/grill. It's always a good idea to use a meat thermometer to ensure they reach the desired level of tenderness. Enjoy your smoked pork spare ribs!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why should people place water pan in the smoker?

Placing a water pan in the smoker serves several purposes that can contribute to a successful smoking experience. Here are the main reasons why people use a water pan:

#### Moisture control
 The water pan helps maintain a moist environment inside the smoker. As the water heats up, it evaporates and creates a gentle steam. This steam helps prevent the meat from drying out during the long smoking process. Dry air can cause the meat to become tough and less flavorful, so the water pan helps retain moisture and promote juiciness.

#### Temperature regulation
 The water in the pan acts as a heat sink, helping to stabilize the temperature inside the smoker. The evaporation process absorbs heat, which helps prevent sudden temperature spikes that could result in overcooked or burnt meat. The water pan acts as a buffer, creating a more consistent and controlled cooking environment.

#### Smoke distribution
 The water pan also plays a role in distributing smoke evenly throughout the smoker. The water vapor carries the smoke particles, ensuring that they are dispersed throughout the cooking chamber. This helps infuse the meat with a more balanced and consistent smoky flavor.

#### Easy cleanup
 The water pan can also catch drippings and prevent them from falling directly onto the heat source or the smoker's bottom. This helps with cleanup, as it reduces the chances of grease and drippings causing flare-ups or creating difficult-to-clean messes.

It's important to note that not all smokers require a water pan, and some smokers may have specific instructions regarding its usage. However, in the case of the Masterbuilt&reg; vertical charcoal smoker/grill, the water pan is commonly used to enhance moisture, temperature control, and smoke distribution.

Remember to regularly check the water pan during the smoking process to ensure that there is enough water. Refill it as needed to maintain the desired level of moisture.

### How do I keep the spare ribs moist when it is uncovered?

When smoking spare ribs, keeping them moist can be a challenge, especially when cooking them uncovered. However, there are a few techniques you can employ to help maintain moisture throughout the smoking process. Here are some tips:

#### Apply a marinade or brine
 Before seasoning the ribs with the dry rub, you can marinate or brine them. Marinating involves soaking the ribs in a flavorful liquid mixture, while brining involves soaking them in a saltwater solution. Both methods help enhance moisture retention and impart additional flavors to the meat.

#### Mop or spritz with a liquid
 During the smoking process, you can periodically mop or spritz the ribs with a liquid of your choice. This can be a simple mixture of water, apple juice, vinegar, or a combination of these ingredients. Mopping or spritzing adds moisture to the surface of the ribs, helping to keep them moist. It also helps enhance the flavor and promotes the development of a beautiful bark.

#### Use a water pan
 As mentioned earlier, using a water pan in your smoker can create a moist environment. The evaporating water helps prevent the ribs from drying out. Place the water pan near the heat source, but not directly under the ribs. The steam generated will circulate around the cooking chamber and help maintain moisture.

#### Wrap the ribs
 If you're concerned about moisture loss, you can choose to wrap the ribs in foil or butcher paper during a portion of the smoking process. This technique, often referred to as the "Texas crutch," helps to retain moisture and accelerate cooking. Once the ribs have reached a desired level of tenderness, you can unwrap them to allow the bark to form and add texture.

#### Rest the ribs
 After the ribs are cooked, it's essential to let them rest for a short period before slicing and serving. Resting allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, resulting in a more moist and flavorful final product.

Remember, even when cooking spare ribs uncovered, they can still turn out moist and tender with proper preparation and attention to the cooking process. By incorporating these techniques, you can help retain moisture and achieve delicious results.

### How much dry rub should I put so that it doesn't block the smokey flavor?

When applying dry rub to your spare ribs, it's important to strike a balance so that it enhances the flavor without overwhelming the smoky taste. Here are some guidelines to help you achieve the desired balance:

#### Start with a moderate amount
 Begin by applying a moderate amount of dry rub to the ribs. You want to ensure that each rib is evenly coated with the rub, but not excessively so. Use your hands to gently massage the dry rub into the meat, ensuring it adheres well.

#### Adjust to personal preference
 The amount of dry rub you use can vary depending on personal taste preferences. Some people prefer a more pronounced spice rub flavor, while others prefer a milder taste that allows the smokiness to shine through. Start with a moderate amount and adjust based on your preferences for future cooks.

#### Consider the strength of the rub
 Different dry rubs have varying levels of intensity in terms of flavor and spiciness. If you're using a particularly strong or spicy rub, you may want to use a slightly lighter hand when applying it to avoid overpowering the smoky flavor. Mild or balanced rubs can be applied more generously without overwhelming the smokiness.

#### Let the smoky flavor develop
 Remember that the smoky flavor will develop over the course of the smoking process, so even if the initial application of dry rub seems substantial, the smokiness will gradually infuse into the meat. The rub will complement and enhance the smoky flavors rather than mask them.

#### Taste and adjust
 If you're unsure about the amount of dry rub to use, you can always taste a small piece of the seasoned meat before it goes into the smoker. This will give you an idea of the overall flavor profile and help you make adjustments if needed.

Ultimately, finding the right balance between the dry rub and the smoky flavor is a matter of personal preference. By starting with a moderate amount and adjusting based on your taste preferences, you can achieve a harmonious blend of flavors that highlight both the dry rub and the smokiness of your spare ribs.

### How long to smoke pork ribs at 225?

The recommended smoking time for pork ribs at 225°F (107°C) can vary depending on several factors, including the size and thickness of the ribs, personal preference for tenderness, and the type of smoker being used. As a general guideline, you can estimate a smoking time of approximately 5 to 6 hours for spare ribs and 3 to 4 hours for baby back ribs at this temperature.

However, it's important to note that these are just estimates, and the key to achieving perfectly smoked ribs lies in monitoring the internal temperature and tenderness of the meat. It's recommended to use a meat thermometer to check the doneness of the ribs. The ribs are typically considered done when they reach an internal temperature of around 195°F (90°C) and when the meat has pulled back from the bone, indicating tenderness.

Throughout the smoking process, it's essential to maintain a consistent temperature of 225°F (107°C) in your smoker. This can be achieved by adjusting the airflow and adding charcoal or wood chips as needed. It's also advisable to periodically spritz or baste the ribs with a flavorful liquid, such as apple juice or a vinegar-based mop sauce, to keep them moist and enhance the taste.

Remember, these are general guidelines, and individual cooking times may vary. It's always recommended to rely on temperature and tenderness as the primary indicators of doneness rather than strictly adhering to a specific cooking time. With practice and careful observation, you'll develop a sense of when the ribs are perfectly smoked and ready to be enjoyed.

### What is the 3 2 1 rule for smoking ribs?

The _3-2-1 rule_ for smoking ribs is a popular method that provides a guideline for achieving tender and flavorful ribs. Here's a breakdown of what each number represents:

- **3:** This refers to the initial stage of smoking the ribs uncovered. It suggests smoking the ribs for approximately 3 hours at a consistent temperature, typically around 225°F (107°C). During this time, the ribs absorb the smoky flavor and start to develop a beautiful crust on the outside.

- **2:** The second number in the rule signifies the next phase, which involves wrapping the ribs in foil or butcher paper. This step helps to tenderize the meat and further enhance its moisture. The wrapped ribs are then returned to the smoker for about 2 hours, still at the same temperature. The enclosed environment created by the foil or butcher paper allows the ribs to steam gently, resulting in increased tenderness.

- **1:** The final number represents the last hour of the smoking process. At this stage, the foil or butcher paper is removed, and the ribs are placed back on the smoker grate. This allows the exterior to firm up slightly, creating a desirable texture and allowing any excess moisture to evaporate. The ribs continue to cook for approximately 1 hour, allowing the flavors to further develop and the surface to caramelize.

It's important to note that the _3-2-1 rule_ is a general guideline, and individual cooking times may vary based on factors such as the size and thickness of the ribs, personal preference for tenderness, and the type of smoker being used. It's always recommended to use a meat thermometer to check for doneness. When the ribs reach an internal temperature of around 195°F (90°C) and the meat has pulled back from the bone, they are typically considered ready to be enjoyed.

Feel free to adjust the timing based on your preferences and the specific characteristics of the ribs you are cooking. The _3-2-1_ method serves as a helpful starting point for achieving delicious and tender smoked ribs, but experimentation and personalization are encouraged to find the perfect balance for your taste.

### How long to smoke ribs at 225 without wrapping?

The cooking duration for smoking ribs at 225°F (107°C) without wrapping can differ based on factors such as the type of ribs, their thickness, and your desired level of tenderness. As a general guideline, you can estimate a cooking time of approximately 5 to 6 hours for spare ribs and 4 to 5 hours for baby back ribs at this temperature.

It's important to note that these are rough estimates, and it's crucial to monitor the ribs closely during the cooking process. The key to achieving perfectly smoked ribs without wrapping is to observe their tenderness and internal temperature.

Use a meat thermometer to check the doneness of the ribs. The ideal internal temperature for fully cooked ribs is around 195°F (90°C). Additionally, you can perform the "bend test" by lifting the ribs with tongs from one end. If they bend easily and the meat starts to pull away from the bone, it indicates that they are approaching the desired tenderness.

Throughout the smoking process, it's important to maintain a consistent temperature of 225°F (107°C) in your smoker. Adjust the airflow and replenish charcoal or wood chips as needed to maintain the desired temperature.

While not wrapping the ribs allows for a crispier exterior and more pronounced smoke flavor, it's important to monitor the moisture levels. Basting the ribs occasionally with a flavorful liquid, such as apple juice or a vinegar-based mop sauce, can help prevent them from drying out.

These are general guidelines, and individual cooking times may vary based on various factors. It's best to rely on temperature, tenderness, and personal preference when determining the readiness of the ribs. With practice and attention to detail, you'll be able to achieve deliciously smoked ribs that are perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor.
