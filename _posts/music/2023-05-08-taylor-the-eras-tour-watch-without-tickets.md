## Overview

**No Ticket? No Problem! How to Still Have Fun at The Eras Tour**

Imagine this: you've always dreamed of going to a Taylor Swift concert during The Eras Tour. You've worked hard, saved up your money, and eagerly waited for the day to arrive. But then disaster strikes! The website crashes, the server fails, and all the tickets are sold out before you can snag one.

It's enough to make any die-hard Swiftie feel like crying. And to make things worse, there was a pandemic right before the concert, making it even more challenging to get tickets. But don't worry, my dear fan. There are still options available. You can search for resale tickets on the internet's hidden corners or get creative, like dressing up as a roadie and sneaking in.

So don't lose hope just yet. Remember, when you're a devoted fan, nothing can stop you. These clever fans have discovered their own ways to experience the enchantment of Taylor Swift.

## Sky-High Swifties: Renting Helicopters for the Ultimate Concert View

Some _Swifties_ went above and beyond to make their concert experience extraordinary. They didn't let anything stand in their way, not even the ground! As the concert day approached, rumors spread about a group of _Swifties_ who actually rented a helicopter. Can you believe it? They wanted to see everything from high up in the sky! And guess what? It actually happened! The helicopter hovered above Nissan Stadium in Nashville, and the fans inside had the most incredible view of the massive crowd below. It was truly amazing and showed just how devoted Taylor Swift's fans are. They'll go to great lengths to be part of such a special event. 

_Swifties_ rented a helicopter to watch. As per Zara Taylor's tweet on May 7th, 2023, "holy jesus ??" [^1].

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">holy jesus ?? <a href="https://t.co/YelvAgNiYs">pic.twitter.com/YelvAgNiYs</a></p>&mdash; klara (@zarastaylor) <a href="https://twitter.com/zarastaylor/status/1655296821088989185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Imagine being up in the sky, looking down at a scene that felt like a magical carnival. The stadium, once impressive on its own, was now bursting with thousands of _Swifties_. They were all there for one thing: the ultimate Taylor Swift experience. It was an incredible sight, with the crowd swaying and singing together, caught up in the enchantment of the moment.

And that's not all! The stadium lights were shining brightly, creating a dazzling show of colors that danced across the excited crowd. It was a sight that would make anyone's heart race. For those lucky fans in the helicopter, this was a memory they would treasure forever. They looked down at the devoted fans below and felt the same excitement and wonder. It was clear that this wasn't just a concert. It was a joyful celebration of life, love, and everything Taylor Swift stands for.

### Party with the _Swifties_ outside Nissan Stadium

#### On a Nearby Bridge

Even if they couldn't get tickets to The Eras Tour at Nissan Stadium in Nashville, some super dedicated Taylor Swift fans didn't let that bring them down. They made the most out of the situation by gathering outside the stadium, and guess what? They even filled up the nearby bridge to create their very own concert experience! Some stood on the sidewalks, while others crowded onto the bridge. They sang along, jumped up and down, and captured the moments on their phones.

The music filled the streets, and people passing by couldn't resist joining in on the fun. The excitement was so infectious! These fans were so happy and involved that it felt like they were actually inside the stadium, sharing the same joy as those lucky enough to have tickets. It was amazing to see how determined and creative Taylor Swift fans can be. They showed incredible resilience and created a truly unforgettable experience.

As [diego @alitooweii](https://twitter.com/alitooweii/status/1655257637104103424) expressed their amazement at the massive crowds gathering outside Nissan Stadium in Nashville for Taylor Swift's concert on May 7th, 2023, stating

> Imagine still denying we’re in the middle of Swiftmania [^2]

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Imagine still denying we’re in the middle of Swiftmania <a href="https://t.co/1RcIjyBJFh">pic.twitter.com/1RcIjyBJFh</a></p>&mdash; diego (@alitooweii) <a href="https://twitter.com/alitooweii/status/1655257637104103424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

[@eboyanti](https://twitter.com/eboyanti) chimed in with her own [tweet](https://twitter.com/eboyanti/status/1655413184860413953) stating,

>I know I was joking about there being more people outside the stadiums than most pop star concerts today but this isn’t even a joke anymore like there’s nobody that is close to her. [^3]

#### Or Just Steps Away From The Entrance Gate

If you ever thought singing to Taylor Swift's greatest hits alone in your bedroom was fun, imagine doing it with a massive crowd outside the streets and parking lots! In a [post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CsPhqq0pJ3a/) by [@van_smithwicks](https://www.instagram.com/van_smithwicks/) on Instagram&trade; [^4], the photo captures _Swifties_ takeover in the streets and parking lots of Lincoln Financial Field, Philadelphia.

The _Swifties_ were filled with so much excitement and energy! They all sang their favorite songs together, jumping and waving their hands in the air. They belted out catchy lyrics like "When the sun came up you were looking at me" from the super popular song "Out of the Woods".

It was truly amazing to see how strangers could come together and bond over their love for Taylor Swift. It's another reminder that music has a special way of bringing people closer and creating a sense of togetherness.

## In Conclusion

It's easy to see that there's never been an artist who is loved and enjoyed as much as Taylor Swift. Her fans are willing to do anything to be part of the excitement. The _Swifties_ in Nashville during The Eras Tour showed incredible creativity, strength, and pure happiness. This proves how powerful music can be and how it can bring people together.

Even if some fans couldn't go to the concert, they made the most of it by gathering outside stadiums like Nissan Stadium and Lincoln Financial Field. They created their own concert experience by singing and dancing together. And guess what? Some lucky _Swifties_ even got to go on a thrilling helicopter ride above the stadium!

The Eras Tour is still going on, but the memories and passion it has sparked will stay with the fans for a long time. Taylor Swift may have been the star on stage, but it was the fans who truly stole the show.
