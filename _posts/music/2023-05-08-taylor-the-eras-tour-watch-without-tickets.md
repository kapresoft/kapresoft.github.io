## Overview

**No Ticket? No Problem! How to Still Have Fun at The Eras Tour**

Picture this: you've been dreaming of seeing Taylor Swift live in concert for The Eras Tour for what feels like forever. You've saved up your money, counted down the days, and made all the necessary sacrifices to be able to make it happen.<!--excerpt--> But when the time comes to buy the tickets, disaster strikes. The website crashes. The server goes down. And before you know it, the tickets are sold out. 

It's enough to make even the toughest _Swiftie_ want to curl up in a ball and cry. And to make matters worse, there was a pandemic just before this concert, which only added to the difficulty of securing tickets. But fear not, dear fan. There are still options. From scavenging for resale tickets on the dark corners of the internet to dressing up as a roadie and sneaking in, the possibilities are endless. 

So take heart, and don't give up just yet. After all, when you're a die-hard fan, nothing can stand in your way.  These creative fans have come up with their own ways to feel the Swift magic.

## Sky-High Swifties: Renting Helicopters for the Ultimate Concert View

The _Swifties_ had gone to great lengths to secure their place at the concert, and nothing was going to stop them. Not even the ground itself. As the hours ticked by, and the excitement reached fever pitch, rumors started to spread throughout the crowds of a group of _Swifties_ who had rented a helicopter to get a bird's eye view of the proceedings. And there it was, hovering above Nissan Stadium in Nashville, defying gravity and convention, as the fans inside it looked down upon the sea of humanity below. It was an incredible spectacle, a testament to the devotion of Taylor Swift's fans, and a sign that they would do whatever it took to be a part of this historic event.

_Swifties_ rented a helicopter to watch. As per Zara Taylor's tweet on May 7th, 2023, "holy jesus ??" [^1].

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">holy jesus ?? <a href="https://t.co/YelvAgNiYs">pic.twitter.com/YelvAgNiYs</a></p>&mdash; klara (@zarastaylor) <a href="https://twitter.com/zarastaylor/status/1655296821088989185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

From high up in the sky, the scene below was like a surreal carnival. The stadium, once an impressive structure, was now bursting at the seams with thousands of _Swifties_, all there for one thing: the ultimate Taylor Swift experience. It was a wild ride, with the crowd swaying and singing in unison, lost in the magic of the moment.

Adding to the spectacle, the stadium lights dazzled and danced, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the enthusiastic crowd. It was a sight that would make anyone's heart skip a beat, and for those in the helicopter, it was a memory they would never forget. Looking down at the devoted fans below, the sense of excitement and wonder was contagious, and it was clear that this was more than just a concert - it was a celebration of life, love, and all things Taylor Swift.

### Party with the _Swifties_ outside Nissan Stadium

#### On a Nearby Bridge

Despite not being able to snag a coveted ticket for The Eras Tour at Nissan Stadium in Nashville, some die-hard Taylor Swift fans decided to make the best of the situation by gathering outside the stadium and even filled the bridge nearby to create their own concert experience. Some took to the sidewalks outside the stadium, while others even filled the nearby bridge. They sang along and jumped while singing, with some recording the moments with their cellphones. 

As the music echoed through the streets, fans passing by couldn't resist joining in on the fun, and the festive atmosphere was contagious. The fans were so happy and engaged that they seemed as if they were inside the stadium, sharing the same joy as those who had managed to secure tickets. It was a remarkable demonstration of resilience and creativity that Taylor Swift fans are known for.

As [diego @alitooweii](https://twitter.com/alitooweii/status/1655257637104103424) expressed their amazement at the massive crowds gathering outside Nissan Stadium in Nashville for Taylor Swift's concert on May 7th, 2023, stating

> Imagine still denying we’re in the middle of Swiftmania [^2]

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Imagine still denying we’re in the middle of Swiftmania <a href="https://t.co/1RcIjyBJFh">pic.twitter.com/1RcIjyBJFh</a></p>&mdash; diego (@alitooweii) <a href="https://twitter.com/alitooweii/status/1655257637104103424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

[@eboyanti](https://twitter.com/eboyanti) chimed in with her own [tweet](https://twitter.com/eboyanti/status/1655413184860413953) stating,

>I know I was joking about there being more people outside the stadiums than most pop star concerts today but this isn’t even a joke anymore like there’s nobody that is close to her. [^3]

#### Or Just Steps Away From The Entrance Gate

If you ever thought singing to Taylor Swift's greatest hits alone in your bedroom was fun, imagine doing it with a massive crowd outside the streets and parking lots! In a [post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CsPhqq0pJ3a/) by [@van_smithwicks](https://www.instagram.com/van_smithwicks/) on Instagram&trade; [^4], the photo captures _Swifties_ takeover in the streets and parking lots of Lincoln Financial Field, Philadelphia.

The energy was absolutely electric as the devoted _Swifties_ belted out their favorite tunes in perfect unison, jumping up and down, and waving their hands in the air singing infectious lyrics like "When the sun came up you were looking at me" from the chart-topping hit "Out of the Woods". 

It was a sight to behold as complete strangers came together in their shared love for Taylor Swift, proving once again that music has the power to bring people together.

## In Conclusion

It's clear that there has never been an artist so loved and enjoyed, with fans going to great lengths to be a part of the excitement. The creativity, resilience, and sheer joy displayed by the _Swifties_ in Nashville during The Eras Tour is a testament to the power of music and the connection it can create between people. 

Despite not being able to attend the concert, fans filled the bridge and sidewalks outside Nissan Stadium, Lincoln Financial Field, and many others, creating their own concert experience complete with singing and dancing. And for some lucky _Swifties_, the experience was taken to new heights, quite literally, with a thrilling helicopter ride above the stadium. 

The Eras Tour may still be ongoing, but the memories and passion it has already inspired will continue to live on in the hearts of fans for years to come. Taylor Swift may have been performing on stage, but it was the fans who truly stole the show.
