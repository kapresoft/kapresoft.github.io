## Overview

Template Method Vs Builder Pattern
<!--excerpt-->

## Comparing Template Method and Builder Pattern

Understanding the differences between the _Template Method_ and _Builder_ patterns is crucial for selecting the appropriate design strategy in software development. Both serve different purposes and are applied in distinct scenarios.

### Core Principles of the Builder Pattern
The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. It allows the same construction process to create different representations. This pattern is typically used when an object needs to be created with many possible configurations and combinations.

### Distinctive Features of Template Method and Builder Pattern
- **Template Method Pattern**:
  - Behavioral pattern: Focuses on the algorithm and its structure.
  - Uses inheritance: Subclasses extend an abstract class to implement parts of an algorithm.
  - Preserves the overarching structure of an algorithm while allowing subclasses to provide specific behavior for certain steps.

- **Builder Pattern**:
  - Creational pattern: Concerned with object creation mechanisms.
  - Separates object construction from its representation: Allows different representations for the object that's constructed.
  - Typically involves a _Builder_ interface with specific methods for building parts of an object and a _Director_ class that constructs the final object using these methods.

### When to Use Each Pattern: Practical Scenarios
- **Use Template Method When**:
  - You have a largely invariant algorithm with some steps that need to be implemented differently in different contexts.
  - You want to avoid code duplication, maintaining the common parts of the algorithm in a superclass.
  - Example: A data analysis program where the steps (data loading, processing, visualization) are the same, but the specifics of each step vary with different data sets.

- **Use Builder Pattern When**:
  - The object creation process is complex, involving multiple steps or configurations.
  - The construction process should be independent from the components that make up the object.
  - Example: Building a customizable Meal object in a food ordering application, where each meal can consist of different combinations of items like a main course, a drink, sides, etc.

Java code examples can further illustrate these patterns:

**Template Method Pattern Example**:

```java
abstract class DataAnalyzer {
    // Template method
    final void analyzeData() {
        loadData();
        processData();
        visualizeData();
    }

    abstract void loadData();
    abstract void processData();
    abstract void visualizeData();
}
```

**Builder Pattern Example**:

```java
class Meal {
    private String mainCourse;
    private String drink;
    // other components

    static class Builder {
        private String mainCourse = "";
        private String drink = "";

        Builder withMainCourse(String mainCourse) {
            this.mainCourse = mainCourse;
            return this;
        }

        Builder withDrink(String drink) {
            this.drink = drink;
            return this;
        }

        Meal build() {
            return new Meal(this);
        }
    }

    private Meal(Builder builder) {
        this.mainCourse = builder.mainCourse;
        this.drink = builder.drink;
    }
}
```

These examples highlight the fundamental differences in purpose and implementation between the Template Method and Builder patterns, guiding developers in choosing the right pattern based on their specific needs.
