# What is Spring Cloud Function?

Spring Cloud Function is a powerful tool for the decoupling of the development life cycle of business logic so that the same code can run as a web api endpoint, a stream processor, or a simple task.

In Addition, the following high-level are worth mentioning

- Allows the developer to focus firmly on business logic and separates the transport details and infrastructure.
- Promote business logic implementations via functions
- Takes advantage of spring boot features including but not limited to auto-configuration, dependency injection, and metrics, in a serverless environment
- Support a uniform and testable programming practice across serverless platform providers, including the ability to run standalone.
