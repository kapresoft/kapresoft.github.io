## III. Personal Life

**Welcome to the United States**

Having accomplished his impressive graduation feat, he set out to gain valuable work experience at a local McDonald's in Faribault, flipping burgers and building essential skills in time management, customer service, and teamwork. Coming from a diverse background, he had moved from Butuan City, Philippines to the colder climate of Northfield, MN and attended Northfield High School. Despite the challenges he faced along the way, his hard work and dedication paid off, allowing him to achieve his goal of graduating at the young age of 16, bypassing middle school.

**U.S. Army Regular**

At a young age of 17, Tony joined the United States Army Regular as a Motor Transport Operator (88M). His journey shows the resilience and dedication to serve his country, and he is grateful for the opportunity to do so after graduating from high school.

When he first joined the Army, he struggled with the physical demands of basic training due to being overweight. However, he maintained a positive attitude and worked hard to overcome the challenge. Eventually, he was stationed at Camp Casey in Dongducheon, South Korea, where he spent six months over two summers helping to guard the border at the DMZ. During his time there, he completed more than 50 missions, including both day and night operations, and was responsible for dropping off and picking up patrols while keeping a watchful eye on North Korean soldiers through the looking glass.

While stationed in Camp Casey, he had the opportunity to participate in multi brigade-wide alert drills several times. These drills simulated the preparation for an attack from North Korea, a challenging task for any soldier, especially someone as young as he was at the time. It was a humbling experience to be part of such critical training exercises.

The experiences he gained during his time in the Army were invaluable, teaching him important skills and lessons that he has carried with him throughout his life. He learned the significance of discipline, teamwork, and leadership, which have played a crucial role in his subsequent endeavors.

**After the Army**

At the age of 20, he left the Army after serving for 3 years and transitioned to the Minnesota Army National Guard, where he served for 5 years while attending college.

After completing his service in the Army, he took advantage of the Veteran's Administration G.I. Bill and U.S. Army Fund Benefits to pursue higher education. He enrolled in Mankato State University (now known as Minnesota State University) and took on several side jobs to help pay for his college and apartment expenses. Additionally, he joined the MN Army National Guard to take advantage of their 50% tuition assistance and book reimbursements program. Eventually, he transferred to the University of Minnesota Institute of Technology (now called College of Science & Engineering since 2010) to continue his studies.

**Minnesota Army National Guard: Faribault, MN**

[//]: # (The infantry is the main land combat force and the backbone of the Army. It's equally important in peacetime and in combat. The Infantryman's role is to be ready to defend our country in peacetime and to capture, destroy and repel enemy ground forces during combat.)

He made a bold move and retrained from a Motor Transport Operator (88M) to an Infantryman (11B), known as "Eleven Bravo". As an infantryman, he became one of the guys in the front line, the ones who face the enemy head-on. The Infantry is the backbone of the Army and plays a crucial role in both peace and wartime. His mission as an Infantryman was to stay vigilant and protect his country during peacetime, and to fight enemy ground forces with everything he had during combat.

**Minnesota Army National Guard: Brooklyn Park, MN**

As a Stinger Missile Operator for an Air Defense Artillery Division in Brooklyn Park, MN, he had extensive training and experience with the Stinger® missile system. He was capable of efficiently deploying the system, whether shoulder-mounted or mounted in a Humvee, to defend against airborne threats. While he had developed a certain level of precision and skill in his role, he was always open to learning more and improving his abilities.

**Internship at Honeywell, Inc.**

During his senior year, he secured an internship at Honeywell, Inc in Golden Valley, MN, where he worked on HVAC microcontrollers.

Antonio received a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Minnesota Institute of Technology, Minneapolis Campus. After working as an I.O. Processor Applications Engineer at IBM's I.O. Processor Group and a Design Engineer II at LSI Logic, Antonio transitioned to software engineering in 2001.
